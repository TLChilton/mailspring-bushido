**Note:** because this is just a personal project, I can't guarantee that the theme will work on Windows or macOS. You are free to make a pull request for these Operating Systems, though.

# Idido

Idido is a theme for the Mailspring mail client, forked from the [Ido theme](https://github.com/edipox/n1-ido), which is in turn based on [Taiga](https://github.com/noahbuscher/N1-Taiga). *Ido* means *offspring* in Esperanto, so *Idido* is *Offspring of the offspring*!

# Theming
The sidebar color can be changed by updating the color value in [this file](https://github.com/NeoMahler/mailspring-idido/blob/master/styles/variables.less#L32). [Here is a video showing how to do that.](https://youtu.be/4L2v6tuAonE)

## Firebrick

## Differences between Ido and Idido
This is a list of the differences between both themes:

* Window controls have been replaced by traffic lights (inspired by macOS).
* Buttons don't have borders (as opposed to the circular borders of the original Ido theme).
* Circular hover effect on buttons.

This is a new fork, so there aren't any more changes. I'll update the list when I make further changes.
